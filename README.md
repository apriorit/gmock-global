# Introduction
[Gmock](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock) is a C++ framework for writing [mock classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object). It is very convenient to create mock objects for mocking of methods. But [gmock](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock) can not mock global functions. This problem is quite common but has no trivial solution. [Gmock FAQ](https://github.com/google/googlemock/blob/master/googlemock/docs/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.md#my-code-calls-a-staticglobal-function--can-i-mock-it) says you are doing something wrong if you need to mock static or global functions. However it is required in some cases and [gmock-global](https://github.com/apriorit/gmock-global) provides such functionality.

# Usage

## Step 1: Adding includes
At first your project needs to know about [gmock-global](https://github.com/apriorit/gmock-global).
1. Add `gmock-global/include` to the project include paths.
2. Add `#include <gmock-global/gmock-global.h>` after [gmock](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock) include.

## Step 2: Declare mock global
Syntax is most similar to [gmock](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock). For example, to mock function `multiply` with two `double` arguments and `double` result you have to write declaration: 
```cpp
MOCK_GLOBAL_FUNC2(multiply, double(double, double));
```
You can check call count of such function using `EXPECT_GLOBAL_CALL` macro, same as you used `EXPECT_CALL` macro for classes: 
```cpp
EXPECT_GLOBAL_CALL(multiply, multiply(1, 2));
```

The `.Times(...)` and other methods will be work too.

In result mocking of global `double multiply(double, double)` looks like:
```cpp
MOCK_GLOBAL_FUNC2(multiply, double(double, double));

...

TEST(TestGlobal, CanMultiplyGlobal)
{
    EXPECT_GLOBAL_CALL(multiply, multiply(1, 2)).Times(1);
    multiply(1, 2);
}
```

Also you can use `ON_GLOBAL_CALL` to specify default behavior. `ON_GLOBAL_NICE_CALL` can be used to set default behavior with suppressed warning when this mock was actually called.

[gmock-global](https://github.com/apriorit/gmock-global) supports more than 10 arguments with [gtest version 1.8.1](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.8.1). But it requires [gmock-more-args version 1.0.1](https://github.com/apriorit/gmock-more-args/releases/tag/1.0.1) in case you use [gtest version 1.8.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.8.0)

# Known issues
The [after clause](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/CheatSheet.md#the-after-clause) can't be using with [gmock-global](https://github.com/apriorit/gmock-global), use `Sequences` instead.
